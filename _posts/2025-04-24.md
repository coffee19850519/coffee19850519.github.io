I am happy to accept the summer internship from [Stower Institute](https://www.stowers.org/) to work in [Computational Biology group](https://www.stowers.org/technology-centers/computational-biology).
My role will involve surveying recent advancements in single cell Large Language Models and deep learning models across downstream tasks and datasets.
