Abstract
=====
Many high-quality biological pathways are presented in figures and text in biomedical literature. They are great resources for studies of biological mechanisms and precision medicine practices. These pathways need to be carefully curated, reconciled, and transformed into a computable form. Current manual curation approaches are inadequate in keeping up with the pace of the literature growth. New bio-curation approaches are needed to streamline the identification of gene interactions from pathway figures and text. This paper proposes a pathway curation approach for identifying genes and their interactions using both figures and text of biomedical articles. Our method integrates deep learning-based object detection models with a Google optical character recognition service to extract genes and their interactions from pathway figures. Our pipeline was evaluated on the figures from PubMed publications with manual annotations. The results demonstrated that our model could effectively retrieve genes and their interactions in pathway figures. The proposed pipeline may accelerate various applications of the latest biomedical discoveries.
