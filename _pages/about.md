I have completed my doctoral degree under the supervision of Professor [Dong Xu](https://engineering.missouri.edu/faculty/dong-xu/) in the [Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://engineering.missouri.edu/departments/eecs/) at the [University of Missouri](https://missouri.edu/) and will join [University of South Florida](https://www.usf.edu/) as an Assistant Research Professor.
 
With a Ph.D. in Bioinformatics and a second Ph.D. in progress in Computer Science, my research focuses on the intersection of AI for Life Sciences, AI for Medicine, and Biometric Security. I am particularly passionate about developing interdisciplinary methodologies that harness the power of AI and foundation models to address challenges in biology, medicine, and data privacy.
