I joined Northeast Normal University ([NENU](https://en.nenu.edu.cn/)) in China in Fall 2015 and am currently an Associate Professor in the [School of Information Science and Technology](https://ist.nenu.edu.cn/). I earned my Ph.D. in Engineering with a specialization in Bioinformatics from [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/), China in 2015 and am currently pursuing a second doctoral degree under the supervision of Professor [Dong Xu](https://engineering.missouri.edu/faculty/dong-xu/) in the [Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://engineering.missouri.edu/departments/eecs/) at the [University of Missouri](), with an expected completion date of December 2025.
 
With a Ph.D. in Bioinformatics and a second Ph.D. in progress in Computer Science, my research focuses on the intersection of AI for Life Sciences, AI for Medicine, and Biometric Security. I am particularly passionate about developing interdisciplinary methodologies that harness the power of AI and foundation models to address challenges in biology, medicine, and data privacy.
